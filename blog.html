        <p class = "title">The power of em and rem</p>
        <article>
            <p>An em value is calculated against the font-size of a current element, so boxes sized with it will consequently scale as font sizes are adjusted by the element or its 
                ancestors. Meanwhile, rem is defined as the font-size of the root element. So, all references to rem will return the same value, regardless of ancestor font size. In 
                effect, rem is a document-wide CSS variable. Browser support for rem is quite good these days. It’s limited on desktop because IE8 does not support it, but common mobile 
                and tablet browsers handle it much better.There are a couple of reasons to use this pattern. Of course you can set everything in pixels, but if you want to make something 
                responsive, you usually need to overwrite more values. And another, maybe more important, reason: some people will have their browser font size set to something else than 
                the default 16px, for example people who are visually impaired. You may be familiar with a browser’s page zoom setting, which scales up all the contents on the page 
                proportionally. A lesser known feature of most browsers, though, is the option to adjust your preferred font size. This feature operates independently from the page zoom 
                feature. For example, these are the options used for the font size drop-down menu in Chrome’s appearance settings — ranging from the very small (9px) through very large 
                (24px) — with the recommended default of medium set at 16px. If you set a higher default font size, you wouldn't have to zoom in the browser to be able to read a website, 
                because the content of a website with relative units would increase with your preferred font size.</p>

        <p class = "title">Html elements and default browser width</p>
        <article>
            <p>There is no default font size for HTML. In fact HTML has nothing to do with it, font size is determined by CSS but there is no default font size for CSS either.If your 
                stylesheet has no font size specified then it is determined by the browser and the standard default font size in most browsers is 16px (usually 16px for body text and 
                different bigger sizes for h1-h6 headings). That said, even though this is the default it can be amended within the browsers user preferences. For example partially 
                sighted people could potentially set this to a larger default browser font size if they chose to do so. therefore if we didn't specify the font size of our html element
                size the browser sets it to it's default value of 16px but if we did specify our html element a size like 200px it will go with this.</p>
